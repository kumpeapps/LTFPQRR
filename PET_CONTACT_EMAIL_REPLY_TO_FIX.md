# Pet Owner Contact Email Reply-To Fix

## Issue
Pet owner contact emails from finders were replying to the support email instead of the finder's email address.

## Root Cause
The email system was missing Reply-To header support, causing email clients to use the "From" address (support email) for replies instead of the intended sender (finder's email).

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Email Functions
- **Updated `send_email()` function** in `email_utils.py` to support `reply_to` parameter
- **Updated `send_email_direct()` function** in `email_utils.py` to support `reply_to` parameter  
- **Added Reply-To header** support to outgoing emails

### 2. Database Schema Enhancement
- **Added `reply_to` field** to `EmailQueue` model in `models/email/email_models.py`
- **Enhanced `EmailManager.queue_email()`** to accept and store reply_to parameter
- **Updated email service** to pass reply_to header when sending emails

### 3. Pet Contact Email Integration
- **Updated `send_contact_email()`** in `utils.py` to pass finder's email as reply_to
- **Enhanced pet email service** to include reply_to in contact emails
- **Ensured pet email processor** uses finder's email for reply_to header

### 4. Database Migration
- **Created SQLAlchemy-based script** to add reply_to column to email_queue table
- **Applied migration** successfully to existing database
- **Removed temporary migration script** after successful execution

## Files Modified

1. **email_utils.py** - Enhanced send_email functions with reply_to support
2. **models/email/email_models.py** - Added reply_to field to EmailQueue model  
3. **services/email_service.py** - Updated EmailManager to handle reply_to
4. **services/pet_email_service.py** - Enhanced pet contact email processing
5. **utils.py** - Updated send_contact_email to include reply_to

## Testing
- **Created test script** `test_reply_to_fix.py` to verify functionality
- **Database migration** completed successfully
- **Reply-to field** properly added to email queue

## Result
✅ **Pet owner contact emails now include proper Reply-To headers**
✅ **Email clients will reply directly to the finder instead of support**
✅ **Backward compatibility maintained** for existing email functionality

## Next Steps
1. Test the functionality with a real pet contact form submission
2. Verify Reply-To headers appear correctly in sent emails
3. Confirm email client behavior when replying to contact emails
