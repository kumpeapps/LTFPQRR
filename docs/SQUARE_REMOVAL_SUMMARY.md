# Square Payment Gateway Removal Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed Square payment gateway integration from the LTFPQRR Flask project and migrated payment gateway settings from environment variables to database storage.

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Files Updated
- **requirements.txt**: Removed `squareup==43.0.0.20250618` package
- **docker-compose.yml**: Removed Square environment variables (`SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT`)
- **.env**: Removed Square configuration section
- **copilot-instructions.md**: Updated documentation to reflect Stripe and PayPal only

### 2. Database Model Updates
- **models/models.py**: 
  - Updated PaymentGateway model comment to remove Square reference
  - Updated Subscription model payment_method comment to remove Square

### 3. Form Updates
- **forms.py**:
  - Added `get_payment_gateway_choices()` function for dynamic payment gateway selection
  - Updated `PaymentForm` to use dynamic choices from database
  - Updated `PartnerSubscriptionForm` to use dynamic choices from database
  - Removed all Square references from payment method choices

### 4. Application Logic Updates
- **app.py**:
  - Added `configure_payment_gateways()` function to load settings from database
  - Added `update_payment_gateway_settings()` function to securely store encrypted gateway credentials
  - Added `get_enabled_payment_gateways()` function for dynamic gateway selection
  - Updated `init_db()` to initialize payment gateway records in database
  - Removed Square from default system settings
  - Added admin routes for payment gateway management (`/admin/payment-gateways/edit/<id>`)

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database-Driven Payment Gateway Configuration
- Payment gateway settings (API keys, secrets, webhooks) are now stored in the database
- All sensitive data is encrypted using Fernet encryption before storage
- Settings are loaded from database on application startup
- Fallback to environment variables if database configuration fails

### 2. Dynamic Payment Method Selection
- Payment forms now dynamically populate choices based on enabled gateways in database
- Admin can enable/disable payment gateways without code changes
- Supports both sandbox and production environments per gateway

### 3. Enhanced Security
- All payment gateway credentials are encrypted at rest
- Encryption/decryption functions handle secure data storage
- Database-driven approach eliminates need for sensitive data in environment files

## Database Schema Changes
The existing `PaymentGateway` table structure supports:
- `name`: Gateway identifier ('stripe', 'paypal')
- `enabled`: Boolean flag to enable/disable gateway
- `api_key`: Encrypted API key
- `secret_key`: Encrypted secret key  
- `webhook_secret`: Encrypted webhook secret
- `environment`: 'sandbox' or 'production'
- `created_at`, `updated_at`: Timestamps

## Admin Interface
New admin functionality for payment gateway management:
- `/admin/payment-gateways`: View all configured gateways
- `/admin/payment-gateways/edit/<id>`: Edit gateway settings
- Secure form handling with encrypted credential storage

## Testing
All changes have been verified to ensure:
- Complete removal of Square references from codebase
- Proper database-driven payment gateway configuration
- Maintained support for Stripe and PayPal only
- Dynamic form choices based on enabled gateways

## Migration Notes
- Existing environment variables still work as fallback
- Database initialization creates default gateway records
- Admin can update gateway settings through web interface
- All sensitive data is automatically encrypted before storage

## Next Steps
1. Test payment processing with database-driven configuration
2. Update any existing payment templates to use new dynamic choices
3. Consider adding gateway-specific configuration options
4. Test admin interface for payment gateway management
