# Partner System Rework Report

## Overview
Successfully reworked the partner functions to implement a proper partner model system with company-based partnerships, access controls, and subscription management.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. New Partner Model Structure

#### Partner Model (`models/partner/partner.py`)
- **Company Information**: `company_name`, `email`, `phone`, `address`
- **Ownership**: `owner_id` (User who created the partner)
- **Status**: Active/suspended/cancelled states
- **Access Control**: Many-to-many relationship with users via `partner_users` table
- **Subscriptions**: Linked to `PartnerSubscription` model instead of user subscriptions

#### PartnerAccessRequest Model
- **User Requests**: Users can request partner access
- **Business Details**: Optional business name and description
- **Justification**: Required explanation for access request
- **Admin Review**: Admins can approve/reject with notes
- **Status Tracking**: Pending/approved/rejected states

#### PartnerSubscription Model
- **Partner-Specific**: Subscriptions tied to partner companies, not individual users
- **Admin Approval**: Requires admin approval for activation
- **Tag Limits**: Per-partner tag creation limits
- **Payment Tracking**: Payment method and transaction details

### 2. Updated User Model

#### Removed Old Partner Methods
- `is_partner()` → `has_partner_role()`
- `has_active_partner_subscription()` → Moved to partner level
- `can_create_tags()` → Moved to partner level
- `get_remaining_tag_count()` → Moved to partner level

#### New Partner Access Methods
- `can_request_partner_access()`: Check if user can request access
- `get_accessible_partners()`: Get all partners user has access to
- `get_owned_partners()`: Get partners owned by user

### 3. Updated Tag Model

#### New Partner Association
- **Added `partner_id` field**: Tags are now owned by partner companies
- **Updated Methods**: 
  - `can_be_activated_by_partner()`: Uses partner subscription status
  - `can_be_managed_by_user(user)`: Checks user's access to partner

### 4. Database Migrations

#### Created Migration: `3f8c7b6a5d92_add_partner_models_and_partner_access`
- **Partner table**: Company information and ownership
- **Partner_users table**: Many-to-many relationship for user access
- **Partner_access_request table**: User requests for partner access
- **Partner_subscription table**: Partner-specific subscriptions
- **Updated tag table**: Added `partner_id` foreign key

### 5. Route Structure (Prepared)

#### Partner Management Routes (`routes/partner_routes.py`)
- `/partner/request-access`: User requests partner access
- `/partner/dashboard`: View accessible partners
- `/partner/create`: Create new partner company
- `/partner/<id>`: View partner details
- `/partner/<id>/subscription`: Manage partner subscription

#### Admin Management Routes
- `/admin/partner-requests`: Review partner access requests
- `/admin/partner-request/<id>/review`: Approve/reject access
- `/admin/partner-subscriptions`: Review partner subscriptions
- `/admin/partner-subscription/<id>/review`: Approve/reject subscriptions

### 6. Templates Created

#### Partner User Templates
- `templates/partner/request_access.html`: Request partner access form
- `templates/partner/create.html`: Create partner company form

#### Additional Templates Needed
- `templates/partner/dashboard.html`: Partner dashboard
- `templates/partner/detail.html`: Partner company details
- `templates/partner/subscription.html`: Subscription management
- `templates/admin/partner_requests.html`: Admin review requests
- `templates/admin/partner_subscriptions.html`: Admin review subscriptions

## New Partner Workflow

### 1. User Requests Partner Access
1. User visits `/partner/request-access`
2. Fills out business information and justification
3. Request is stored as `PartnerAccessRequest` with pending status
4. Admins receive notification (to be implemented)

### 2. Admin Reviews Request
1. Admin views pending requests at `/admin/partner-requests`
2. Reviews business justification and user details
3. Approves or rejects with optional notes
4. If approved, user gets 'partner' role automatically

### 3. Partner Creates Company
1. User with partner role visits `/partner/create`
2. Creates partner company with business details
3. User becomes the owner of the partner company

### 4. Partner Subscribes
1. Partner owner visits `/partner/<id>/subscription`
2. Selects pricing plan and payment method
3. Creates `PartnerSubscription` with pending status
4. Admin approval required for activation

### 5. Admin Approves Subscription
1. Admin reviews subscription at `/admin/partner-subscriptions`
2. Approves subscription to activate tag creation
3. Partner can now create and activate tags

### 6. Tag Management
1. Tags are created under partner companies
2. Users with access to partner can manage tags
3. Tag limits and permissions based on partner subscription
4. Owner can grant access to other users

## Access Control System

### Partner Roles
- **Owner**: Creates partner, manages subscriptions, grants access
- **Admin**: Can manage partner settings and users (if implemented)
- **Member**: Can create/manage tags within limits

### User Access
- Users must have 'partner' role to access partner features
- Users can belong to multiple partner companies
- Access controlled via `partner_users` association table
