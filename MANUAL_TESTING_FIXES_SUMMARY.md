# Manual Testing Error Fixes - Summary Report

## Date: July 12, 2025

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Partner Dashboard URL Building Error
**Error**: `Could not build url for endpoint 'create_tag' with values ['partner_id']. Did you mean 'tag.create_tag' instead?`
**Location**: `/templates/partner/detail.html` line 141
**Fix**: Updated URL reference from `url_for('create_tag', partner_id=partner.id)` to `url_for('tag.create_tag', partner_id=partner.id)`
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 2. Stripe Payment Intent Content-Type Error
**Error**: `415 Unsupported Media Type: Did not attempt to load JSON data because the request Content-Type was not 'application/json'`
**Location**: `/routes/payment.py` - `create_stripe_payment_intent` route
**Fix**: 
- Added fallback logic to handle both JSON and form data
- Enhanced logging to debug request details
- Improved error handling
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 4. Admin Partner Subscriptions Page Not Showing Data
**Error**: Admin partner subscriptions page showing no subscriptions despite data existing
**Location**: `/routes/admin.py` - partner subscription routes
**Root Cause**: Routes were querying `Subscription` model instead of `PartnerSubscription` model

- Updated approve/reject functionality
- Linked missing pricing plans to existing partner subscriptions
**Status**: ✅ FIXED
